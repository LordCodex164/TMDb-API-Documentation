# The Movie Database (TMDb) API Documentation

## Introduction

The Movie Database (TMDb) API is the api where you can find definitive lists of currently available methods for movie, tv, actor and image APIs. It is also a popular and a user editable database for Movie Shows. The Purpose of the API is to create endpoints for developers who are looking to integrate Movie, tv and image APIs into their Applications.

## Getting Started

### Get started with the basics of the TMDB API.

Before using the API, ensure you have your api key to test the (TMDb) API. If you donâ€™t have one yet, you can create it [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) from your account setting page.

Please be well informed that the registration process is not well optimized on mobile devices and only be done on a Laptop or Desktop.

Once you have been given an API key, follow this use case for an API Key based request

```
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/11?api_key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
```

In this case after having your api key based request, you can go on [postman](https://www.postman.com) to test it and inspect how your data should look like: 

```js

> Before proceeding further, it is highly recommended you use postman to test the endpoints.

## Authenticating Requests

### Application Level Authentication

There is a term which is basically used to authenticate a user when sending requests. When sending requests to an api endpoint, there is a need to authenticate those requests and it is only possible with a token. In this case, we will be using our access token as a Bearer token to authenticate our requests. To get the access token, head into your account page, under the API settings section, you will see a new token listed called API Read Access Token. This token is expected to be sent along as an Authorization header. A simple cURL example using this method looks like the following

curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/11' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJhZGYxZjgyN2VmMTVhYWE2ZjVlZDIxOTk0ZmVmNzZkYyIsInN1YiI6IjY1NDNjNGU5NzcxOWQ3MDExYzkyOTJhMyIsInNjb3BlcyI6WyJhcGlfcmVhZCJdLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoxfQ.SdGVUI7GLQPfIYcJmLiFWxmgjVccJQiL8DWQ198yhCs'

When you have the access token, a single authentication process is performed throughout the application.

## Testing Endpoints

In the previous section, you looked at application level authentication and how it works using the (TMDB) Api. In this section, you will be exploring different key endpoints.

## Rate Limiting

It is a technique or method that restricts the amount of requests made to a server or service so as to reduce traffic flow. According to [TMDb](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/rate-limiting) as of December 16th, 2019, 
the original rate limiting (40 seconds per second) was disabled. However, upper limits are still put in place to ensure that excessive bulk scraping is mitigated and reduced.

## Usage Guidelines

In the previous section, you covered the term rate limiting and why it is used in an api. Now, let's delve into best practices for using the TMDb API effectively and responsibly.

1. Ensure to set up Postman for API testing. If you still donâ€™t know how, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0CZ5V5kzEo).

2. Read and review the [(TMDB) Official documentation](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) yourself to understand how the API works.

3. API key: Sign up for a TMDb API key by visiting [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

4. Access Token: Head into your account page, under the API settings section, you will see a new token listed called API Read Access Token which you will pass as your authorization header.

5. Test Endpoints: Check the TMDb endpoints and start testing on Postman to have access to their data.

6. Respect Rate Limits: Rate Limits are now disabled. However, there are still higher limits that are imposed by TMDb.

## Testing Methods

In this section, I will suggest two(2) methods that you can use to test the TMDb API effectively.

**Manual Testing** : With this method, APIs are tested manually by sending HTTP requests using tools like Postman. You can primarily interact with the postman user interface 
as a manual tool to test APIs and inspect responses.


**Automated Testing** : This method involves using specialized software tools to automate a human driven manual process. An automating tool is required in this method in writing test cases. 
Examples of automated testing tools include Newman which is a command line collection runner for postman. Newman allows you to run postman collection directly from the command line.
